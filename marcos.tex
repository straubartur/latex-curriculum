\section{About Me}
\emph{Although my degree in Computer Science is recent, I've worked three years in the Bridge Laboratory at UFSC doing some amazing stuff.
I'm always searching different ways to improve myself and my coworkers knowledge. The Bridge Lab, for instance, has encouraged me in teaching. This helped me increasing not only my professional experience, but my personal relationships.
My focus is always in creating the best solutions, using the right tools. And more important, never deny any technology due some misleading preconception.
